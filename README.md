This repository stores the code for my Masters Thesis project on Deep Q-Learning. The final thesis paper can be read [here](thesis/Caleb%20Cassady%20-%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20with%20Deep%20Q-Networks.pdf).  

This project was developed using the Pytorch and OpenAI Gym libraries for machine learning. The Deep Q-Learning algorithm implementations were build on top of these frameworks. Multiple variants of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm are included, and for this project their performances were compared in multiple learning environments.
